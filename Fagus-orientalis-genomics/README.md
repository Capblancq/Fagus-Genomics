### Forest genomics in the Caucasus through the lens of its dominant tree species - Fagus orientalis
---------------------

This repository includes all the scripts used to perform the analyses and produce the figures of the study described in Capblancq et al. 2024, Molecular Ecology (XX):

1. The "Bio-informatics" directory includes all the scripts used to process the sequence data and conduct downstream analyses that provided outputs that were then used to produce the figures of the paper.
  
3. "Sequencing.R" can be used to draw Figure 1 from summary statistics estimated on the seuqence aligments (.bam files).

4. "Diversity_sites.R" can be used to draw figure 2 from the output of the subprogram of ANGSD "thetaStat".

5. "Structure_Forientalis.R" describes how to use PCAngsd and NGSadmix outputs to draw figure 3.

6. "Script_stairwayplot.R" describes how to use STAIRWAY PLOT outputs to draw figure 4.

7. "Diversity_genome.R" can be used to draw figure 5 from the output of the subprogram of ANGSD "thetaStat".
